Description: library of RGB color manipulation functions
 This library provides functions for converting between RGB (red, green,
 blue) color components and HSV (hue, saturation, value) color components.
 It helps you convert among Emacs color components (whole numbers from 0
 through 65535), RGB and HSV floating-point components (0.0 through 1.0),
 Emacs color-name strings (such as "blue"), and hex RGB color strings (such
 as "#FC43A7912").
